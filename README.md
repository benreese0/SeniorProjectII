Arduino Controls of the Car

The Arduino program at this point is controlling 2 servos based on controls coming in from the Serial port. 

Functional Controls are as follows:
1. F - the capital letter F followed immediately by an int of value from 1000-2000 gives the car a speed. 1000-1499 is a reverse speed where 1000 is the greatest and 1499 is the slowest. 1501-2000 is a forward speed where 1501 is the slowest and 2000 is the fastest. 
2. R - the capital letter R followed immediately by an int of value from 0-50 gives the car a right turn of the angle given. 
3. L - the capital letter L followed immediately by an int of value from 0-50 gives the car a left turn of the angle given. 
4. S - the capital letter S with no parameters is to immediately stop the car.
